            <h2>Minimum Advertised Price Policy (MAP)</h2>
            <p>
                Chums, Inc. (“Chums”) has determined that its interests are best served through the adoption of a
                minimum advertised price (“MAP”) policy. This MAP policy is designed to (1) protect reseller margins
                so that desirable pre-sales and post-sales services and infrastructure can be provided by our channel
                partners (2) support the Chums brand as a premium offering; and (3) avoid destructive intra-brand
                channel conflict. Chums is committed to enforcing policies which allow our resellers to maintain
                appropriate profit margins through the sale of our products. Chums has established a Minimum
                Advertised Price Policy that an Authorized Reseller must follow for the advertising and marketing of
                Chums products. All Chums Authorized Resellers must agree to the terms and conditions of the
                following MAP Policy.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    This policy has been unilaterally adopted by Chums and will be uniformly enforced.
                </strong>
            </p>
            <h3>Policy Coverage.</h3>
            <p>
                This MAP policy covers all Chums Offline and Online resellers located in the United States. Although
                resellers remain free to establish their own resale prices, Chums will, without assuming any liability,
                unilaterally take actions and impose consequences as described in this policy against resellers who
                advertise applicable Chums products at prices below full MSRP. Chums will not discuss any conditions
                of acceptance related to this MAP policy, as it is non-negotiable, and will not be altered for any reseller.
                Chums neither solicits, nor will it accept, any assurance of compliance with this MAP policy. Nothing
                in this MAP policy or in any other contract or agreement with Chums shall constitute an agreement
                between Chums and reseller that the reseller will comply with this MAP policy.
            </p>
            <p>
                MAP applies only to minimum advertised prices and does not apply to the price at which the products
                are sold, or to advertised prices higher than the unilateral minimum resale prices established by Chums
                from time to time. Chums may permit resellers to advertise MAP products at prices lower than the MAP
                price at specified times. In such events, Chums reserves the right to modify or suspend the MAP price
                with respect to the affected products for a specified period of time by providing advance notice to all
                resellers of such changes.
            </p>

            <h3>Minimum Advertised Price.</h3>
            <p>
                The current listing of products and applicable MAP prices are published on Chums’s website on the
                Price List page. The products and MAP may be changed from time to time in Chums’s sole discretion.
                Chums resellers are responsible for remaining current with MAP policy, products and pricing. Chums
                products not specifically identified in this policy are not subject to the MAP policy. Each advertisement
                below the MAP will constitute a violation of this MAP policy.
            </p>
            <p>
                The MAP policy applies to all advertisements of specific Chums products in and all media including,
                without limitation, flyers, posters, coupons, mailers, inserts, newspapers, magazines, catalogs, mail order
                catalogs, Internet or similar electronic media, television, radio and public signage.
            </p>
            <p>
                Where Chums products are bundled with or sold as part of a package that includes other products
                (whether or not manufactured by Chums), it shall be a violation of this MAP Policy to sell or advertise
                the bundle (or package) at a price that: (a) is lower than the total Minimum Advertised Price of the
                Chums product or (b) violates the letter or spirit of the MAP Policy. It shall be a violation of this MAP
                Policy if products are bundled with or sold as part of a package that includes products not pre-approved
                by Chums.
            </p>

            <h3>Policy Violations.</h3>
            <p>
                In the event a reseller violates the Chums MAP policy, sanctions will be unilaterally imposed by Chums.
                Violations of MAP policy shall be determined by Chums in its sole discretion.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to the above, failure to adhere to the MAP policy will be a factor taken into consideration in
                the determination of the reseller’s future product orders and cooperation with Chums. Failure to adhere
                to MAP will result in the following notifications.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>1st Violation:</strong> Authorized Reseller’s will receive an email notification detailing the MAP violation.
                MAP violations must be corrected within 24 hours from the time of notification.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>2nd Violation:</strong> Authorized Reseller’s account will be placed on hold for 6 months pending discussion
                with Chums representative.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>3rd Violation:</strong> Authorized Reseller’s account will be placed on a permanent hold. Chums will review
                and determine if account is to be reinstated.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>4th Violation:</strong> Should Chums decide to reinstate an Authorized Reseller who has previously
                demonstrated a third violation, yet violates a fourth time, the account will be unauthorized indefinitely.
            </p>
